Django Seattle Presentations
============================

Our monthly meetings happen on the fourth Tuesday of the month. Meeting announcements are made on our [Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Django-Seattle/).

## Interested in presenting?

It's easy! Submit a github issue with a quick summary of what you want to present, 1-2 sentences is fine. Include your name and tell us a little bit about yourself, provide relevant links, whatever's appropriate.

Presentations do not have to be Django-specific. We're interested in hearing about other aspects of web development, too!

_We welcome talks of all kinds and skill levels and we're interested in helping local developers improve their presentation skills. After you've submitted your issue, we'll reach out if your presentation is accepted and work with you to get you on the schedule._
